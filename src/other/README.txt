README file for the awakening console application.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The awakening program is an implementation of the solo AI for
the board game Labyrinth: The Awakening, 2010 - ?, 
designed by Trevor Bender and published by GMT Games.

The program is implemented in the Scala programming language
and therefore requires the Java JVM.  It is a text based 
console application and should run on Mac OSX, Windows and
Linux.

To run the program
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Ensure that Java is installed on your system and that the java
   executable can be found on your PATH.
   
2. Run the awakening script located in the same directory
   as this README file. (On Windows, use the awakening.cmd script)

3. If all is well, the game will prompt you for a scenario and you
   will be off and running.
   
   
More Details
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. You will be presented with a Command: prompt.  You can type
   'help' to get a list of valid commands.  You can type 
   'help <command>' to get more detailed help on a particular command.
   
2. Any time the game prompts you for a value (a command, a country name, etc.),  
   you only need to enter the first few characters of the value.  For example,
   if you want to enter "Saudi Arabia" as the target of an event, you can simply
   type 'Sau'
   
3. Your game will automatically be saved after each card play.
   When you resume a game in progress, the game will load the most
   recent save file.
   The games are saved in a 'games' subdirectory that is created
   in the same directory as this README file.  Each game will have
   its own subdirectory within 'games'.  To delete a saved game,
   simply delete its corresponding subdirectory.
   
4. There is a 'resolve plot' command, but you should rarely need to 
   use it.  The game will detect when plots need to be resolved
   automatically.
 
5. Once all cards have been played by both sides, use the 'end turn'
   command to do all the end of turn stuff.  If there are
   unresolved plots on the map, they will be resolved first.  
   
6. You can use the 'rollback' command to roll back to the beginning
   of a previous card play, or the beginning of a previous turn.
   
7. Look at the help for the 'show' and 'history' commands.  They are
   very useful for making sure your board is in sync with the game.
   If you find any inconsistencies, you can use the 'adjust' command.
   

Configuration file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a file called 'awakening_config'.  You can use this 
to set default parameters if you like, so that you will not 
be prompted every time you start a new game.  See the 
comments in that file for more information.


Command line
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Type 'awakening --help' (awakening.cmd --help on Windows) to
see the available command line options.  Any option typed
on the command line will override a value set in the
configuration file.
