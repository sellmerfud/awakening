## Overview
This is a console application that implements the AI Bots for the board game
*Labyrinth: The Awakening, 2010 - ?*, designed by Trevor Bender and published by GMT Games.
The AI Bots were designed by Adam Zahm.

This program supports the scenarios and event cards from the original Labyrinth game as well
as those for the Awakening explansion and the Forever War expansion.
You must have a copy of the board game in order to use this program.

You can play as either the US or the Jihadist player and the AI will take the opposing side.

## Running the program

This is a Scala program, so you will need to have the Java JVM installed and make sure that
the `java` command is on your `PATH`

There are two scripts provided that will start the program.

* `awakening` -- As bash script used on Mac and Linux
* `awakening.cmd` -- A Windows command file for use on Windoze

## Downloading the package

You can download the zip file with the latest release (version 4.16) [here][1]

If you are upgrading to a newer version and the **major** version numbers of the two versions
are the same, then any saved games in progress will be compatible.

Simply copy the *games* folder from the older *awakening-x.x* directory to the 
new *awakening-x.x* directory.

## Using the program

When you first run the program, it will prompt you to enter:

1. The scenario that you wish to play
2. Whether you are playing a single scenario or a campaign game.
3. The side you wish to play (US or Jihadist)
4. The difficulty level
5. A name for your game (so your progress can be saved)

Your game is saved after each card play, plot resolution, etc.  You can use the 
`show plays` command to see the cards that have been played during the current turn.

The next time you run the program, it will ask if you want to resume a saved game.

## Entering commands
To enter a card play for the Jihadist side simply enter `j 121`.  This indicates that the
Jihadist plays card #121.  For a US card play you would enter `u 200`.

Use the `help` command to see all the available commands.  You can get further help for 
a specific command by typing its name after `help`. For example for help on the `show` 
command, type `help show`.

The `show` command allows you to inspect the current state of the board.

The `history` command allows you to review the current turn, previous turns or the 
entire game log.

The `rollback` command will let you restart the game from:

* the beginning of a previous card during the current turn
* the beginning of a previous turn

You can also abort the current card that you are playing at most prompts by entering `abort`.


All commands can be shortened to the prefix of the command name that is unique.  The `j 121` 
command is actually shorthand for `jihadist 121`.

In fact this use of abbreviated prefixes works at every prompt in the game.  So if you are
choosing the country where you want to conduct a Jihad, you can enter `sau` to indicate 
`Saudi Arabia` or `uk` for `United Kingdom`.  If the prefix you type is not unique, the 
program will display the valid choices.

There is a `resolve plots` command, but you will rarely need to use it.  The program will
detect when a new action phase has started and if there are unresolved plots, they will be
resolved.

When all cards for a turn have been played, use the `end turn` command to perform the
end of turn housekeeping.

When playing a campaign game and you come to the end of a particular deck of cards,
you must enter the appropriate command to let the software know that this has occurred:

    add awakening - The game starts using the Awakeing expansion rules.
                    The Bots use the appropriate priorities for Awakening.
    add forever   - The Bots use the appropriate priorities for Forever War.
