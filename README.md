## Overview
This is a console application that implements the AI Bots for the board game
*Labyrinth: The Awakening, 2010 - ?*, designed by Trevor Bender and published by GMT Games.
The AI Bots were designed by Adam Zahm.

This program supports the scenarios and event cards from the original Labyrinth game as well
as those for the Awakening explansion and the Forever War expansion.
You must have a copy of the board game in order to use this program.

You can play as either the US or the Jihadist player and the AI will take the opposing side.

## Downloading the package

You can use this link to download the latest release: [Version 6.0][1]

If you are upgrading to a newer version and the **major** version numbers of the two versions
are the same, then any saved games in progress will be compatible.

Simply copy the *games* folder from the older *awakening-x.x* directory to the 
new *awakening-x.x* directory.

## Running the program

This is a Scala program, so you will need to have the Java JVM installed and make sure that
the `java` command is on your `PATH`

There are two scripts provided that will start the program.

* `awakening` -- As bash script used on Mac and Linux  
*(Note: the code that creates the zip file does not preserve the executable bit
on the script so you will need to make it executable or run it with bash)*
* `awakening.cmd` -- A Windows command file for use on Windows

## Using the program

When you first run the program, it will prompt you to enter:

1. The scenario that you wish to play
2. Whether you are playing a single scenario or a campaign game.
3. The side you wish to play (US or Jihadist)
4. The difficulty level
5. A name for your game (so your progress can be saved)

Your game is saved after each action.  You can use the 
`show actions` command to see the actions that have been performed during the current turn.

When you run the program after you have one or more saved games then you will be asked
if you want to resume a saved game.

## Action Prompt
The program displays a prompt allowing you to enter the action that you wish to perform.
At the start of a new game the prompt will look this this:
```
========================================================
| Jihadist Bot's 1st action phase               Turn 1 |
| 0 Cards played                             9 in hand |
| 0 Ops in reserve                    102 in draw pile |
========================================================

Play card
--------------------------------------------------------
Show | History | Adjust | Quit | ?
========================================================
Action:
```
Here we can see that we are in the first turn of the game and it is the Jihadist Bot's
action phase.  Next we see the available actions.  The action(s) above the single dashed line are those
that pertain to game play.  The actions below the line allow you to view and manage the game status.

To enter a command you type its name.  And for convenience you can simply type the first character of
the command name.  Most commands accept arguments which can be typed following the command name.  If you
enter a command without any arguments, then you will be prompted to enter the necessary values.
You can get help for any command by following the entering the single argument *help* or *?*. For example
to get help for the *History* command you would type: `history help` or more simply `h ?`.

Normally, the only command above the dashed line is the *Play card* command.  This allows you to enter
the next card to be played for the for the active side (*Jihadist in our example*).  So to have the
Jihadist play a card you would enter `p` followed by the number of the card. 
The *Play card* command is the most common command used in the game, so for this command you can omit the command name
and simply enter the card number.  

For example the following are all ways to play the *Leak* card which is card number 85.
```
play 85
p 85
85
```
*Note: when playing against the [Enhanced Jihadist Bot](#enh-jihad-bot) you may enter two card numbers.*

Once two cards have been played during an action round you will be asked if the action phase should
be ended.  Normally you will answer yes so that the game is advanced to the next action round for the
opposing side.  If you answer no, then you will be shown the action prompt allowing you to inspect game
state, roll back the last card play, etc.
In this case the only command available above the dashed line will be to end the action phase.
```
Two cards have been played.
End the current Jihadist action phase? (y/n) n

========================================================
| Jihadist Bot's 1st action phase               Turn 1 |
| 2 Cards played                             7 in hand |
| 0 Ops in reserve                    102 in draw pile |
========================================================

End action phase
--------------------------------------------------------
Show | History | Rollback | Inspect | Adjust | Quit | ?
========================================================
Action:
```

## Entering Country names

When the game prompts for the name of a country, you can abbreviate the name of the country
by using the shortest unique prefix.  For example you can shorten `Saudi Arabia` to `sau`.
(Upper and lower case letters are matched equally).
For the `United States` and `United Kingdom` you can use `us` and `uk` respectively.

If the prefix you type is not unique, the program will display a menu with the valid choices:
```
'ca' is ambiguous.  Choose one:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1: Canada
2: Caucasus
3: None of the above
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Selection:
```

In fact this abbreviation of values is not limited to country names.  It works for all of the prompts used in the game.

## Multi Deck and Campaign Games

When playing a multi-deck game the software detects when the draw pile does not have enough cards to fill
both hands and will instruct you to reshuffle the discard pile.  When you reach the end of the last
deck the software will display the Victory information.

When playing a campaign game and you come to the end of a particular deck of cards,
the software will instruct you to add the next deck for the appropriate expansion.
When moving from the *Labyrinth* deck to the *Awakening* deck, the software will begin to
enforce the appropriate rule changes associated with the *Awakening* expansion.

## Color on Windows

The software uses different colors when displaying log messages so that it is easier to follow what it happening.  On older versions of Windows the command prompt did not support color.  If your log messages look garbled with ANSI color codes then your version of the Windows command prompt does not support color.  You can use the command: `adjust color` to turn off the use of color.

To avoid having to type this command for every new game you can
create a file called `C:\Users\<user name>\awakening_config` with the following:
```
color = no
```

It is my understanding that color support started with *Windows 10 version 1909 (Nov 2019 Update)*.

If you are using a version from *Windows 10 version 1511 (November Update, 2015-11-03)* to *Windows 10 version 1903 (May 2019 Update)* then
color support can be enabled using a registry setting. See [this post](https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-ansi.html) for more information.


## <a id="enh-jihad-bot">Enhanced Jihadist Bot</a>

In addition to the standard US and Jihadist Bots described in the *Labyrinth: The Awakening, 2010 â€“ ?* rulebook, the
software also impements an Enhanced Jihadist Bot designed by Florian Ottich.  When playing a game as
the US player, you will be prompted for which Jihadist Bot you wish to play.

When it is the Enhanced Jihadit Bot's action phase and the Bot has 2 or more cards in hand, you will be prompted
to enter the top *two* cards from the Bot's hand.  The Enhanced Bot will decide which card to play first.  To speed
things up you can avoid the second prompt by entering both card numbers.  
For example if the top two cards on the Bot's hand are \#85 and \#12 you could enter both cards using any of the
following:
```
play 85 12
p 85 12
85 12
```
If you forget to enter two cards, the software will prompt you for the second card.

For more details on how the Enhanced Bot is implemented see the pdf files in the `doc` directory of installed
software.
